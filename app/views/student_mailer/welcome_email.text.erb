Hello <%= @student.name%>, you are now a Papyrus User!
------------------------------------------------------

You have been registered with Library Accessibility Services to receive Transcription Services via Papyrus our new, automated delivery system.

Here is your account information:

  Your user name is: <%= @student.username %>
  Your login URL is: <%= @url %>

You will want to bookmark this URL, as it is where you will log in to retrieve your readings.

Here’s How Papyrus Works:
	1. When your alternate format course material is available for delivery, you will receive an email notification from papyrus-las@library.yorku.ca
	2. This email will contain the login URL.  When you select the URL, you are prompted to log in with your user name and Passport York password.
	3. In order to comply with Copyright requirements you will next have to agree to the TERMS OF USE.
	4. Once you have indicated your agreement to the TERMS OF USE, you are successfully logged in.  A list of books and course kits assigned to you is displayed by title.
	5. You will want to download and open the zipped files, as indicated on the screen.

You can log on at any time, from any computer.

Each reading, provided in an accessible PDF format, will be made available to you for the duration of the course. At that time the URL will no longer be functional and access to the material will cease.    

Let’s get started shall we?  Two sample downloads for you to try have be sent to you from papyrus-las@library.yorku.ca:
	Library Accessibility Services Student Responsibilities Guidelines
	Mary Lamb

Please contact Transcription Services by email (matalt4u@yorku.ca) should you have any questions or concerns regarding this method of delivery. It is important to note that you cannot reply to email messages generated by Papyrus. 

Sincerely, The Transcription Services Team
